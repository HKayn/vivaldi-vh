# v1.2.0 Changelog

## Changes

- Vivaldi VH no longer requires the title bar to be shown.
- Toolbar linebreaks are now available.
  - *"[Click here to find out how to set up toolbar linebreaks.](../command-chain-utilities.md)"*
- Command Chain Flags, Command Chain Utilities and flexible spaces are now highlighted in the toolbar editor.
- Command Chain Flags and Command Chain Utilities now remain hidden when Vivaldi VH is disabled due to invalid settings.
- When `addressbar-universal-flex-grow` or `statusbar-universal-flex-grow` is disabled, components of the respective toolbar are now initially justified to the left instead of centered.
  - *"This change was required to implement the layout of Vivaldi VH without a title bar. Rest assured that centered toolbar components can still be achieved using flexible spaces."*
- Documentation and demo images have been updated.
- Unused source code has been removed.
