## Available Utilities

### Toolbar linebreak

`vvh-insert-linebreak`

When placed in a toolbar, this will move all toolbar components after it to a new row.

Special interactions:

- If a Toolbar Linebreak is placed immediately before and after a mail search toolbar component, that search bar will grow to take up the full width of the toolbar that contains it.
